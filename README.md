This repository contains two examples I implemented and more examples will be uploaded shortly. Here is a list of 
the examples: 

(1) Support Vector Machines - The core optimixzation routine was coded in C++ from scratch and python-c++ binding was 
    applied to complete the full implementation and application. In this example, we will download the 
    MNIST handwritten digits and create a soft-SVM to predict the digit category (0-9) 
    
(2) Mountain Car Continuous Version 0 - This is a module from Google OpenAI Gym, a standard and simple exercise for 
    reinforcement learning. I coded it using a value iteration method, called Q-learning, in conjunction with neural 
    network. The combination is called Deep Q-Network (DQN) method. 
    
(3) Stock Trading Using Reinforcement Learning - It is under testing now and will be uploaed to the respository shortly

(4) Valuation of Structured Finance Products Uing Deep Learning - It is being tested now will be uploaed to the 
    respository shortly
