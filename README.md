This repository contains several examples I implemented and more examples will be uploaded shortly. Here is a list of 
the examples: 

(1) Decision Tree Ensembles - It contains a decision tree implementation based on ID3, C4.5 and CART algorithms. Addition 
    to the decision tree implementation, bagging and random forest were also implemented. All these implementations were 
    completed from SCRATCH, i.e.; we DID NOT rely on any available packages to facilitate the implementations. These were 
    coded in python programming language. 

(3) Support Vector Machines - The core optimization routine was coded in C++ from scratch and python-c++ binding was 
    applied to complete the full implementation and application. In this example, we downloaded the 
    MNIST handwritten digits and created a soft-SVM to predict the digit category (0-9) 
    
(3) Reinforcement Learning - It contains two examples: Mountain Car Continuous Version 0 and Stock Trading Algorithm. These 
    were coded in python programming language. 
    
    Mountain Car Continuous Version 0 - This is a module from Google OpenAI Gym, a standard and simple 
    exercise for reinforcement learning. I coded it in python using a value iteration method, called 
    Q-learning, in conjunction with neural network. The combination is called Deep Q-Network (DQN) method.  
    
    Stock Trading Using Reinforcement Learning - It is under testing now and will be uploaed to the 
    respository shortly.
